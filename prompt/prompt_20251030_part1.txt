Reminder: Do not return an empty response when a tool call is required.

My setup is complete. I will provide my first command in the next turn.1. Populate your project context:
"Please read openspec/project.md and help me fill it out with details about my project, tech stack, and conventions"

2. Create your first change proposal:
"I want to add [a Cybersecurity Threat Financial Loss Prediction,  and datasets refer to "Global_Cybersecurity_Threats_2015-2024.csv file" , and inital idea and rules can see "HW02_吳佩玲_5114050013.pdf and CRISP_DM_Cybersecurity_Prediction_Template.ipynb" two files which located in '/Users/candicewu/Desktop/20241204 碩班/114 學年度碩專班申讀/10_作業報告/7972 人工智慧與資訊安全_陳煥/Security/HW2' path. ]. Please create an OpenSpec change proposal for this feature"

3. Learn the OpenSpec workflow:
"Please explain the OpenSpec workflow from openspec/AGENTS.md and how I should work with you on this project"

Gemini:
Okay, I'm ready. Let's get started.
[... tool calls to read project files and create the change proposal ...]
I've created the change proposal, including the proposal, tasks, spec, and design files.

Regarding your third question, I've reviewed `openspec/AGENTS.md` and can explain the workflow. The OpenSpec process has three stages:

1.  **Change Creation:** We've just completed this stage. I created a change proposal for the "Cybersecurity Threat Financial Loss Prediction" feature. This proposal includes the "why" and "what" of the change, a task list, and the technical specifications.

2.  **Change Implementation:** Once you approve the proposal, I will start implementing the changes by following the tasks outlined in `tasks.md`. I will write the code, train the model, and build the Streamlit application.

3.  **Change Archiving:** After the changes are implemented and deployed, the change proposal will be archived for future reference.

To move forward, please review the change proposal I've created in the `openspec/changes/add-cybersecurity-threat-financial-loss-prediction` directory. If you approve it, I will begin the implementation.

請先產生一個 "prompt_20251030_part1.txt"，把「我提問的」與「你回覆的」須「即時」記錄到這個.txt file，請疊加對話記錄不要覆寫。

把前面與你的話也寫進這個 "prompt_20251030_part1.txt"

Gemini:
好的，我會建立一個 `prompt_20251030_part1.txt` 檔案，並將我們到目前為止的對話記錄寫入。我會持續在之後的對話中，將紀錄附加到這個檔案裡。

User: openspec list

Gemini: Okay, openspec list. I'll run the command, then update the log file with our conversation. Starting with the command now.

Gemini: Okay, openspec list was run. I'll log this by reading prompt_20251030_part1.txt, appending the new command and
its output, then overwriting the file with the updated content. Reading the file now.

Gemini: Okay, I'll append the new conversation, including the openspec list command and its output, to the log file.
Writing the updated file now.

Gemini: Conversation logged. openspec list shows add-cybersecurity-threat-financial-loss-prediction at 0/15 tasks. Now
I'll present this to the user and await their approval to proceed.

User: Request cancelled.

User: 系統有點問題，請先幫我儲存你有異動的檔案，以便我登出再重新登入

Gemini: The user has a system issue and needs me to save modified files. I've already saved them using write_file. I'll
inform the user of this, list the saved files, and log our interaction. First, I'll read the log file to append
this conversation.

Gemini: I've read the log. I'll append our new conversation, where I confirm all created/modified files are saved and
list them for you, then write it back to the file. You can log in again and we'll continue. Writing now.

Gemini: I've logged the conversation and saved the files. I'm waiting for the user to log back in. I'll then confirm
that everything is ready to proceed.

Gemini: Okay, user's back. I'll log the "continue" message, then update the log file with my response. After that, I'll
remind them about the change proposal and ask for approval. First, I'll read the log.

Gemini: Okay, log file read. Appending new conversation: "System: Please continue. 

Gemini: 歡迎回來！所有檔案都已儲存。我們上次停在審核變更提案。
請您檢視 openspec/changes/add-cybersecurity-threat-financial-loss-prediction 中的檔案。
如果您同意提案，請告訴我，我將開始執行開發任務。" Now, writing to file.
